- 👋 Hi, I’m @LiamHilton
- 👀 I have a passion for coding and Front End Web Development which has lead me to doing The Complete Web Developer in 2024: Zero to Mastery course through ZTM.
- 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning html, CSS and JavaScript / advanced Javascript whilst implementing GitHub and best workflow practices before learning more about React.js. Im am all about learning the foundations of any subject to my best ability and practising by doing. Rome was not built in a day but by courage to fail and learn we can all become better coders by the day.
- 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any creative projects that will test me to push and grow as a web developer 👨‍💻
- 
- - 📫 With more practise through ZTM and my own projects i will continue to make commits to enable me to grow my understanding of the importance of Github in a workspace.
